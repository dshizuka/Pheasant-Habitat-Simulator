# Pheasant-Habitat-Simulator

A shiny application for making quantitative species-habitat models more accessible through reactively updating plots. The Species Habitat Simulator was built for the specific application of a ring-necked pheasant distribution model in Nebraska, USA, but may easily be customized to other species and systems. Just BYO regression equation.
